# Notice
Going forward, we are eliminating the forge ecosystem from our targets. It has proven difficult to work with, and with fabric's enthusiastic support of mixins, we have decided to make the permanent migration. As such, all current code is deprecated and will be rewritten for the newer versions of minecraft. Please see the [fabric-rewrite](https://github.com/Frontear/Infinity/tree/fabric-rewrite) branch for the most up-to-date code. Once we feel the rewrite has encompassed the features of the original forge build, we will replace this master branch with it, however until then the master branch will remain as a mirror.
