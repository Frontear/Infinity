Infinity is a simple client designed in [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html). It adds a variety of features into minecraft, and also comes with performance improvements and bug fixes. This is possible due to [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin).

Before starting, please make sure you have a thorough understanding of mixins and java. Additionally, we recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as your Java IDE alongside the [MinecraftDev](https://github.com/minecraft-dev/MinecraftDev) plugin.
